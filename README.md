## Specification

Implement an option to filter by tags.

You are free to use a state-management solution of your choice.

### User flow

1. The User clicks on the Tags header in the table which opens a dropdown menu.
1. In this dropdown menu, the user clicks filter.
1. This opens another dropdown menu in which the user can select the Tag to filter by. This actually filters the table.
1. The selected Tag is shown above the table.
1. The user can remove the filter by interacting with the selected Tag filter above the table.

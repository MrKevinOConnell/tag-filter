## Preface
Thanks for your interest in joining us! This assignment is meant to give us an idea of your Frontend skills to better asses how you could fit in the team.

Please note that we __don't expect you to take more than three hours__ for this assignment. You don't need to implement everything if you are running out of time. In that case, it is fine to focus on one specific part, e.g. designing a beautfil drop-down.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Specification

Implement an option to filter by tags.

You have to use [https://tailwindcss.com/](TailwindCSS) to style the front-end. For some basic components, you may use [https://headlessui.com/](headlessUI), which you can style with TailwindCSS. Please don't use any other UI libraries.

You are free to use a state-management solution of your choice.

Below you can find an example of a user flow. Feel free to deviate from it if you deem necessary.

### User flow (Example)

1. The User clicks on the Tags header in the table which opens a dropdown menu.
1. In this dropdown menu, the user clicks filter.
1. This opens another dropdown menu in which the user can select the Tag to filter by. This actually filters the table.
1. The selected Tag is shown above the table.
1. The user can remove the filter by interacting with the selected Tag filter above the table.

## Deliverable

A forked version of this repository that implements the user flow described above.

Your main focus should be delivering a good User Experience.
